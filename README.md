# Beat-saver-song-sorter
I got slightly annoyed that bsaber/beat saver doesnt provide enough search options 

(and searching by top doesnt seem to actually search by upvotes)

so...

we have this, its not the greatest in user friendlines but it mostly works and can pretty easily be changed to do what you want

and it requires mongodb to be installed
